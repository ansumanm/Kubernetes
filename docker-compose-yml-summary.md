A `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Here's a summary of its structure and key elements:

1. **Version**: Specifies the version of the Compose file format. The version you use depends on the Docker Engine version.
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   ```

2. **Services**: The main part of the Docker Compose file where you define the different containers (services) you need to run your application.
   ```yaml
   services:
     web:
       image: nginx:alpine
       ports:
         - "80:80"
     app:
       build: ./app
       environment:
         - NODE_ENV=production
     db:
       image: postgres:12
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_DB=mydb
         - POSTGRES_USER=user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
   ```

3. **Build**: If you need to build an image rather than pulling an existing one, you specify the path to the directory containing the Dockerfile.
   ```yaml
   build: ./dir
   ```

4. **Ports**: Maps ports between the container and the host system.
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "4000:80"
   ```

5. **Volumes**: Mounts paths between the host and the container. Used for persistent or shared data.
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /var/lib/mysql
     - ./cache:/tmp/cache
   ```

6. **Environment**: Sets environment variables inside the container.
   ```yaml
   environment:
     NODE_ENV: development
   ```

7. **Depends On**: Specifies dependencies between services, determining the order of service startup.
   ```yaml
   depends_on:
     - db
   ```

8. **Networks**: Defines and configures networks. Useful for creating a custom network topology.
   ```yaml
   networks:
     - backend
   ```

9. **Other Common Options**:
   - **Command**: Overrides the default command specified in the image.
   - **Links**: Links one container to another. Mostly replaced by networks.
   - **Labels**: Adds metadata to containers.
   - **Restart**: Specifies restart policies (e.g., `on-failure`, `always`).

10. **Full Example**:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     web:
       image: nginx:alpine
       ports:
         - "80:80"
       volumes:
         - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
       networks:
         - frontend
     app:
       build: ./app
       environment:
         NODE_ENV: production
       networks:
         - frontend
         - backend
     db:
       image: postgres
       environment:
         POSTGRES_DB: mydb
         POSTGRES_USER: user
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
       networks:
         - backend

   networks:
     frontend:
     backend:
   ```

This file sets up three services (`web`, `app`, and `db`), each of which runs in a separate container. The `web` service uses an NGINX image and maps port 80 to the host. The `app` service is built from a local Dockerfile and is connected to both `frontend` and `backend` networks. The `db` service uses the PostgreSQL image, sets up environment variables, and connects to the `backend` network.

`docker-compose.yml` files greatly simplify the deployment of multi-container applications, ensuring each service is configured and works together as intended.
